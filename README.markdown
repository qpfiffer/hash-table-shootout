How to run these benchmarks
===========================

I ran this on an Amazon EC2 m2.4xlarge instance with the Red Hat 6.1 x86_64 AMI (ami-31d41658).

Setup:
------

    $ yum install make-3.81-19.el6.x86_64            \
                gcc-4.4.5-6.el6.x86_64               \
                gcc-c++-4.4.5-6.el6.x86_64           \
                python-devel-2.6.6-20.el6.x86_64     \
                glib2-devel-2.22.5-6.el6.x86_64      \
                boost-devel-1.41.0-11.el6_1.2.x86_64 \
                qt-devel-4.6.2-17.el6_1.1.x86_64     \
                git

    $ wget http://google-sparsehash.googlecode.com/files/sparsehash-1.11-1.noarch.rpm
    $ rpm -i sparsehash-1.11-1.noarch.rpm
    $ git clone git://github.com/timonk/hash-table-shootout.git

To run:
-------

    $ cd hash-table-shootout
    $ mkdir build
    $ make
    $ python bench.py
    $ python make_chart_data.py < output | python make_html.py

Your charts are now in charts.html.

You can tweak some of the values in bench.py to make it run faster at the
expense of less granular data, and you might need to tweak some of the tickSize
settings in charts-template.html.

To run the benchmark at the highest priority possible, do this:

    $ sudo nice -n-20 ionice -c1 -n0 sudo -u $USER python bench.py

You might also want to disable any swap files/partitions so that swapping
doesn't influence performance.  (The programs will just die if they try to
allocate too much memory.)
